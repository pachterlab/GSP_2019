# Protein acceleration

This GitHub repository contains the Python code for reproducing the analysis and figures in the protein acceleration publication (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/658401v2), as well as pre-processing directions to harmonize source .bam and .loom files. 
The version of the protaccel package is equivalent to to https://pypi.org/project/protaccel/0.301/ and https://zenodo.org/record/3620874. A Google Colaboratory notebook https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UhemkpBT5YtgN9kjuzIKY7uGbl9-phwX allows the immediate reproduction of the CITE-seq processing in the cloud.
